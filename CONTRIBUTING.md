# Bug Reports & Debugging

Whenever you write a bug report, it helps tremendously if you include debug logs directly (otherwise we will just ask for them and it will take longer). So please enable debug logs like this and include them in your issue:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.localtuya: debug
```

Please check for existing issues before opening a new bug report; and follow the issue template guidance.

## Stale reports

Unfortunately, not everything can be resolved, and older issues will often be closed if there is a lack of activity or little concrete action possible. Where possible, make sure your report is clear, concise and as much as possible, reproducable.

Feature requests, while quite welcome, are often best expressed as a pull request with an implementation or proof of concept.
